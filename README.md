# Stock Prediction Model with LSTM and Dense Layers
This repository contains a stock prediction model implemented using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Dense layers based on the Sequential model architecture. The model is designed to forecast future stock prices based on historical data.


# Overview
The stock prediction model utilizes the power of LSTM, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), to capture long-term dependencies and patterns in the stock market data. LSTM is particularly effective in modeling time series data and has been successful in various sequence prediction tasks.

The model architecture consists of multiple LSTM layers followed by Dense layers. The LSTM layers extract relevant temporal features from the historical stock price data, while the Dense layers integrate these features and make predictions for future stock prices.
